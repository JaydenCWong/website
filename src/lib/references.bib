 abstract = {"To understand" was the goal I gave for my high school yearbook, and this is still what drives me. I love to reach understanding: first, to see something (big or little) that doesn't make sense or is simply discordant, then to reflect and ponder, to search and stare in my mind's eye until sometimes, miraculously, vision is transformed and mist and muddle develop into form, order, and connection.Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding. I've loved mathematics all my life, although I often doubted that mathematics would turn out to be my life's},
