        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 4th year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about exploring the vast and ever-evolving world of technology. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer engineering principles, and I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I am dedicated to continuous learning, always eager to delve into new technologies and expand my skill set. Beyond the digital realm, I find balance through my love for boxing, a sport that not only keeps me physically active but also instills discipline and determination.</p>
            <p>While my professional experience is currently limited, my ability to grasp new concepts quickly, coupled with a genuine enthusiasm for trying new things, drives me to embrace challenges and seek opportunities for growth. I am confident that my proactive approach, coupled with a strong academic background, positions me as a motivated individual ready to contribute to and thrive in the dynamic field of computer engineering.</p>
            <p>I am eager to embark on new experiences, apply my skills, and contribute to innovative projects that align with my passion for technology and learning.</p>
